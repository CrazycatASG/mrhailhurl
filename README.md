# Mr HailHurl: The sequel to the (second) worst AUR package manager (WIP)

So, any of you true \#hailfireogs would probably remember HailHurl. It was an awful, shittly scrapped together shell script using
commands I barely understood myself. I **hated** it. So here we are, rewriting it in a language I'm far more familiar with. 

Yippie :>

## So, what is HailHurl?
Copied from the old README, HailHurl (derivied from Hail's Helpful Useful AUR Helper) is a extremely simple AUR helper, which
follows Unix philosophy, to make each program do one thing well. In this case, it handles your AUR packages with ease and 
minimalism.
